# UBIKA WAAP Cloud on Google Cloud Platform
UBIKA WAAP is compatible with Google Cloud Platform.

The linking procedure between a Managed instance and a Manager instance is proper to this environment and is described below.

By default, an instance created on Google Cloud Platform is automatically configured as Manager.

So, there are further operations to perform in order to configure an instance as Managed.

## Setting up a Management instance

1. Connect to the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select your project,

2. In the top left corner, click on the "Navigation menu" and then "Marketplace",

7. Connect via SSH on port 22 with an user of an SSH key defined in (Compute Engine -> Metadata -> SSH Keys).

## Connection modes and credentials
### Text-based User Interface (TUI)
Google Cloud Platform does not allow a connection to the physical console of the instances. So, the only way to connect to a console is via SSH.
Therefore, the SSH mode is automatically enabled on the instance installed on Google Cloud Platform.
To launch the TUI, switch to dashell user
```
> su dashell
```

You will asked to reset the password at the first connection.
