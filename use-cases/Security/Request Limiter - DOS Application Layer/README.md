Presentation
------------

The **Request Limiter** node, available within a workflow, allows you to limit the number of requests to a resource or an application during a limited period.

Backup
------

Download the use case backup: [Request Limiter.backup](./backup/Request%20Limiter.backup)
Download the use case with websocket backup : [Request Limiter with Websocket.backup](./backup/Request%20Limiter%20with%20Websocket.backup)

Reminder
--------

By default, there is no restriction on the number of incoming requests.
And the WAF only allows protection of applications against DOS on layer 7, DOS on network layer 4 must be detected and controlled upstream of the WAF.

Usage
-----

Add a Request Limiter node within a workflow before security engine to avoid unnecessary security check.

For instance, here is the configuration of a Request Limiter node with a maximum of 10 requests in 2 seconds that will check
source IP, session and cookies.

You can also check for specific information from the request. Here is a configuration with a maximum of 5 requests per second for requests containing a **Location** header.

For workflows that have to deal with websockets, specifically block websocket traffic:

Benefits
--------

*   Protects applications against flood by limitating the number of requests by user, containing attacks or not.
*   Can limit CPU usage of some nodes, like the ICX Security Engine node if the Request Limiter node is acting before.

Disadvantages and limits
------------------------

Have to be well sized according to the application to avoid blocking legitimate users.

Example: loading many elements on one page (css, javascript, images...). One request can easily load 10 elements so 11 requests passing through the WAF.
